## Git Branching Strategy for Multi-Service Applications

This document outlines a Git branching strategy designed to facilitate seamless collaboration and integration with the CI/CD process in multi-service applications. The strategy encompasses guidelines for branch naming, branching off, merging strategies, and conflict resolution.

### Branch Naming Convention

1. **main:** Represents the primary development branch where stable and production-ready code resides.
2. **feature/{service-name}/{feature-description}:** Feature branches are created for developing new features or implementing significant changes specific to a particular service. Branch names should be descriptive, indicating the service and feature being worked on.
3. **bugfix/{service-name}/{bug-description}:** Bugfix branches are utilized to address specific bugs or issues identified in the codebase of a particular service. Branch names should denote the service and the bug or issue being resolved.
4. **hotfix/{service-name}/{hotfix-description}:** Hotfix branches are created to swiftly address critical issues or bugs in the production environment of a specific service. Branch names should describe the hotfix being applied and the service it pertains to.

### Branching Off

- Developers should create feature or bugfix branches off the main branch.
- Hotfix branches should be directly created from the main branch.

### Merging Strategies

- **Feature Branches:** Completed feature branches should be merged back into the main branch via pull requests, ensuring code review and validation.
- **Bugfix Branches:** After fixing a bug, the bugfix branch should also be merged back into the main branch via pull requests to maintain code integrity.
- **Hotfix Branches:** Hotfix branches should be merged directly into the main branch to expedite the deployment of critical fixes. Subsequently, changes should be propagated to relevant release branches if applicable.

### Handling Conflicts

- Regularly pull changes from the main branch into feature or bugfix branches to minimize conflicts.
- Resolve local conflicts promptly by collaborating with team members.
- Utilize Git's interactive rebase or merge strategies for complex conflicts, ensuring a systematic approach to conflict resolution.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Submit all changes via pull requests to ensure visibility and traceability.
- Include descriptive titles and summaries in pull requests to communicate the purpose of the changes effectively.
- Conduct thorough code reviews before merging pull requests to uphold code quality and adherence to standards.

### Release Management

- Conduct regular releases from the main branch to ensure the availability of stable versions.
- Create release branches from the main branch at specific points to stabilize code for deployment.
- After a release, merge changes from the release branch back into the main branch to maintain synchronization.

### Example Branching Workflow

- **Feature Development:**
  - Developer creates a feature branch `feature/service-name/new-feature` from the main branch.
  - Developer implements the new feature, commits changes, and pushes the feature branch.
  - Upon completion, the developer creates a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.

- **Bugfix:**
  - Developer creates a bugfix branch `bugfix/service-name/issue-description` from the main branch.
  - Developer fixes the identified bug, commits changes, and pushes the bugfix branch.
  - Developer submits a pull request to merge the bugfix branch into the main branch after thorough testing and validation.

- **Hotfix:**
  - Operations team creates a hotfix branch `hotfix/service-name/critical-issue` directly from the main branch.
  - Operations team applies the necessary fix, commits changes, and pushes the hotfix branch.
  - After verification, the hotfix branch is merged directly into the main branch for immediate deployment.

By adhering to this branching strategy, teams can effectively manage code changes, streamline development processes, and ensure the seamless integration of multiple services in a multi-service application.
